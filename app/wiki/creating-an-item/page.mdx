# Creating an Item

<Box>

Has this ever happened to you? You're making a shop, but then you realize you don't have any items to sell! Happens all the time, right? What do you mean there isn't a shop tutorial yet...?

Creating items mostly involves copy pasting, then changing a few values. It's not too hard, but it can be a bit tedious if you're making a large amount of them.

## Basic Items
---

Let's say you want to make an item that does, well, nothing but take up inventory space. Just make a new Lua file in `data/items`.

Here's an example item. It's useless, but it's an item.

```lua
local item, super = Class(Item, "useless_item")

function item:init()
    super.init(self)

    -- Display name
    self.name = "Useless Item"
    -- Name displayed when used in battle (optional)
    self.use_name = nil

    -- Item type (item, key, weapon, armor)
    self.type = "item"
    -- Item icon (for equipment)
    self.icon = nil
    -- Whether this item is for the light world
    self.light = false

    -- Battle description
    self.effect = "Useless"
    -- Shop description
    self.shop = "Useless"
    -- Menu description
    self.description = "This item is useless"
    -- Light world check text
    self.check = "It's useless"

    -- Default shop price (sell price is halved)
    self.price = 0
    -- Whether the item can be sold
    self.can_sell = false

    -- Consumable target mode (ally, party, enemy, enemies, or none)
    self.target = "none"
    -- Where this item can be used (world, battle, all, or none)
    self.usable_in = "none"
end

return item
```

See, it's just changing a bunch of variables. But, what if we want it to *do* something? That's where `self.target` and `self.usable_in` come in.

---

### `self.target`

`self.target` determines who the item can be used on. It can be one of the following:
- `ally`: you pick an ally to use the item on
- `party`: you use it on the entire party
- `enemy`: you pick an enemy to use the item on
- `enemies`: you use it on all enemies
- `none`: there's no target, you just use it

---

### `self.usable_in`

`self.usable_in` determines where the item can be used. It can be one of the following:
- `world`: you can use it in the overworld
- `battle`: you can use it in battle
- `all`: you can use it anywhere
- `none`: you can't use it

---

### Making it do something

Let's make it usable in the overworld. That's easy, just change `self.usable_in` to `"world"`. We should also make you select an ally to use it on, so change `self.target` to `"ally"`.

```lua
function item:onWorldUse(target)
    return false
end
```

This is the function that gets called when you use the item in the overworld. It takes one argument, `target`, which is the target you selected.

So uh, let's make it explode people. This is why I wanted the player to select a target.

```lua
function item:onWorldUse(target)
    local character = Game.world:getPartyCharacter(target)
    if character then
        character:explode()
    end
    return false
end
```

If you give yourself the item, then try to use it on someone, they explode! Perfect, right?

## Heal Items
---

Heal items are simple, just extend `HealItem` instead.

You'll want to set `self.heal_amount` to the amount you want the item to heal the user. And... that's the only difference. Neat.
