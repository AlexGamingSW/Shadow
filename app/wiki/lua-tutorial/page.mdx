# Lua Tutorial

<Box>
Lua is the programming language used by Kristal. In this tutorial, we'll go over the basics of Lua, and how to use it.

## Using Lua
---

For this tutorial, we are going to be testing using the [official online Lua demo](https://www.lua.org/demo.html).

This is a great place to try the language out.

## PART 1: The Basics
---

Lua is a very simple language. It is very easy to learn, and is very powerful.

---

### Strings, And Your First Program [strings]

First, let's start with a very, very simple program:

```lua
print("Hello, world!")
```

Type this in the box, and press the "run" button. You'll see the output in the box below. Congratulations, you've made your first Lua program!

So, what's happening here? Well, let's break it down in parts.

- `print` - This is a function name. Functions are chunks of code which do something. In this case, the `print` function prints out whatever you give it.
- `"Hello, world!"` - This is a string. Strings are a sequence of characters. In this case, it's the text we want to print. Strings are denoted by quotation marks.
- `()` - These are parentheses. They are used to call functions, and to input data into one. In this case, we gave `print` a string, being `"Hello, world!"`.
- `""` - These are quotation marks. They are used to denote strings.

Strings are a very important part of Lua. They are used to store text. They can be used to store anything, from a single letter, to a whole book. They are very, very useful.

---

### Numbers

```lua
print(5 + 10)
```

This will print out `15`. This is because `5 + 10` is `15`. Lua can do math!

And this brings us to another data type: numbers. Numbers are, well, numbers. They can be integers (whole numbers), or decimals (numbers with a decimal point). Lua can do math with numbers.

```lua
print(0.1 + 0.2)
```

This will print out `0.3`.

---

### Variables

Variables are another important part of Lua. Variables are used to store data. Let's try this:

```lua
local x = 5
print(x)
```

This will print out `5`. This is because we stored the number `5` in the variable `x`, and then printed it out.

Let's try another example:
    
```lua
local x = 5
local y = 10
print(x + y)
```

This will print out `15`. This is because we stored the number `5` in the variable `x`, and the number `10` in the variable `y`, and then printed out the sum of `x` and `y`.

Yes, it works with strings as well!

```lua
local x = "Hello!"
print(x)
```

This will print out `Hello!`. This is because we stored the string `Hello!` in the variable `x`, and then printed it out.

---

### Comments

Comments should be everywhere in your code. They are used to explain what your code does, and why it does it. They are also used to disable code.

```lua
print("Hello!")
-- print("Goodbye!")
```

This will ONLY print out `Hello!`. This is because the second line is commented out. This means that it is ignored by the interpreter.

Comments are denoted by `--`. Anything after `--` on a line is ignored.

You can also make a comment span multiple lines:

```lua
--[[
This is a comment.
It spans multiple lines.
]]
```

---

### Strings, Continued

Strings are actually a bit more complicated than what we've seen so far. For example, this is a valid string:

```lua
[[
This is a string.
It spans multiple lines.
]]
```

That looks a lot like multiline comments, right? This is a long string, which spans multiple lines. Instead of using `"`, we use `[[` and `]]` to denote a multiline string!

Additionally, you can use strings like `'this'` instead of `"this"`. They are the same thing.

But wait, if you have a string like `"this"`, how do you put a quotation mark in it? Well, you can use `\"` to put a quotation mark in a string. For example:

```lua
print("\"Hello!\"")
```

This will print out `"Hello!"`. This is because we used `\"` to put a quotation mark in the string.

What if we wanted to add two strings together? Well, we can use `..` to do that:

```lua
print("Hello" .. " world!")
```

This will print out `Hello world!`. And of course, you can use variables in strings:

```lua
local x = "Hello"
print(x .. " world!")
```

This will print out `Hello world!` as well.

---
### Booleans

Conditions are a very important part of programming. They are used to check if something is true or false. For example:

```lua
if 5 > 10 then
    print("5 is greater than 10!")
end
```

This will print nothing. This is because `5 > 10` is false. `>` is a comparison operator. It compares two values, and returns true or false. In this case, `5 > 10` is false, so the code inside the `if` statement is not run.

So where does the boolean type come in? It's simple. Everything between `if <...> then` is evaluated, and then the result is used.

So, doing `5 > 10` alone gives us `false`! We can even store this in a variable:

```lua
local x = 5 > 10 -- false
local x = false  -- false
local x = true   -- true
```

And then we can use it in an `if` statement:

```lua

local x = 5 > 10 -- false
if x then
    print("5 is greater than 10!")
end
```

And of course, this prints nothing!

---

### Functions

Functions are used to store chunks of code, and to run them later. For example:

```lua
local function add(a, b)
    return a + b
end

print(add(5, 10))
```

This prints 15, because we defined a function called `add`, which takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns `a + b`. Then, we called the function with `5` and `10`, and printed the result. Functions are very useful. They allow you to reuse code, and to make your code more readable.

There's a massive list of built-in functions, and yes, `print` is one of them! We've been using a function this entire time.

Functions, like any other data type (like strings, numbers, etc) are actually able to be stored in variables.

This is the exact same as the example above:

```lua
local add = function(a, b)
    return a + b
end
```

Using a function like this is called an anonymous function. This is because the function has no name. It is stored in the variable `add`.

You can even store named functions in variables as well:

```lua
local function add(a, b)
    return a + b
end

local add2 = add
```

`add2` is the exact same as `add`!
---

### Tables

Tables store data. Think of them as a list of values. For example:

```lua
local x = {
    "One",
    "Two",
    "Three"
}
```

This creates a table with **three items**. The first item is `"One"`, the second item is `"Two"`, and the third item is `"Three"`. We can access these items like this:

```lua
print(x[1])
```

Using [index] on a table will return the item at that index. In this case, it will print `One`, because the first item is `"One"`.

We can also add items to a table:

```lua
table.insert(x, "Four")
```

This will add `"Four"` to the end of the table. Now, `x[4]` is `"Four"`.

But be careful, because anything outside of the table's length will return `nil`:

```lua
print(x[5]) -- nil
print(x[0]) -- nil
print(x[500]) -- nil
```

You can get the length of a table using `#` before the variable:

```lua
print(#x) -- 4
```

---

### Tables, Continued

Tables can also have keys. Keys are used to access items in a table.

```lua
local x = {
    one = "One",
    two = "Two",
    three = "Three"
}
```

To access these items, we use the key:

```lua
print(x["one"])
```

This'll print `One`, because the key `one` is `"One"`.

We can also use the dot operator to access items:

```lua
print(x.one)
```

This is the exact same as `x["one"]`! You can even chain them:

```lua
local x = {
    one = {
        two = {
            three = "Three"
        }
    }
}
print(x.one.two.three)
```

This will print `Three`!

---

### Loops

Loops are used to repeat code. For example:

```lua
for i = 1, 10 do
    print(i)
end
```

This prints out every number from 1 to 10. This is because the `for` loop repeats the code inside of it 10 times. The variable `i` is used to keep track of how many times the loop has run. It starts at 1, and goes up to 10.

What if we want to skip every other number? Well, we can use the `step` argument:

```lua
for i = 1, 10, 2 do
    print(i)
end
```

See that 2? That's the **step**, being how much `i` increases every loop.

We can also use the `while` loop:

```lua
local i = 1
while i <= 10 do
    print(i)
    i = i + 1
end
```

`while` loops until the condition is false. It's like mixing `for` and `if` together! Be careful you don't accidentally make an infinite loop, though:

```lua
while true do
    print("Oh no!")
end
```

This function loops forever, because `true` is always, well, true!

---

### Putting It All Together

Let's make a program which takes a table of numbers, and prints out the sum of all of them:

```lua
local function sum(x)
    local total = 0
    for i = 1, #x do
        total = total + x[i]
    end
    return total
end

local x = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }

print(sum(x))
```

Let's break it down:

- First, we make a function. This function takes a table of numbers, and returns the sum of all of them.
- In that function, we make a variable called `total`, which is used to store the sum of all the numbers.
- We use a for loop to loop through every number in the table.
- We add the number to `total`.
- We return `total`.
- Outside of the function, we make a table of numbers.
- We call the function with the table, and print the result.

And that's it for the basics! That's... quite a bit, right? Don't worry, it's not as complicated as it seems. Well, yet, anyway.

---

### Scopes And Local Variables

We've been using the keyword `local` all over the place, what gives?

Well, `local` is used to make a variable local to a scope. A scope is a chunk of code. For example:

```lua

local x = 5

if true then
    local x = 10
    print(x)
end

print(x)
```

The first `x` is local to the entire program. The second `x` is local to the `if` statement. This means that the first `x` is not affected by the second `x`.

So, we get the following output:

```
10
5
```

Scopes can contain other scopes. For example:

```lua
local x = 5

if true then
    print(x) -- prints 5
    local y = 10
    print(y) -- prints 10
end

print(y) -- prints `nil`, because the variable doesn't exist in this scope!
```

---

That's it for the basics! You can now make simple programs, and you know how to use variables, functions, and tables. It's good that's all there is, right? ...right?
