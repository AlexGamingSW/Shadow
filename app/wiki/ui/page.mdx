# The UI System

<Box>
The UI system, while being a bit complicated, is very powerful.
It allows you to create custom UIs such as menus, HUDs, and more.

## The Basics

---

A UI is made up of **components**. A component is a single piece of the UI.

Let's take the main menu as an example. The soul is a component, each menu item is a component, and the Kristal logo is a component.

Components all do different things, and are all used in different ways.
You can even __create your own components__ if required, which is more than likely.

There are many types of components, but they all have a few things in common:
- They all have a parent, except for the **root component**.
- They can all have children.
- They all have sizings.
- They all have margins and paddings.

But what do these things mean, exactly?

## The Anatomy of a Component

### Margins and Paddings

As stated before, components have **margins** and **paddings**.
What are these things, and why do *all* components have them?

The answer becomes quite clear when you remember that components can have children. Margins and paddings are used to space out components from each other.

A component is a box.
A margin is the space between the box and other boxes, and a padding is the space between the box and its contents.
Margins and paddings can be different for each side, as well.

In the following image, both the margins and the paddings are 20 pixels on each side.
The cyan area represents the margins, and the pink area represents the paddings. The white box is the component itself.

In Kristal, turning on **debug rendering** will show you the margins and paddings of each component.

### Sizings

Sizings determine the size of a component. There's a horizontal sizing and a vertical sizing.

#### `FixedSizing(number size, number? size_2)`
This sizing is simple. It makes the component a fixed size which will not change.

If `size_2` is provided, the sizing will assume that `size` is the width and `size_2` is the height.

This means that `FixedSizing(100, 100)` is the same as `FixedSizing(100)`.

#### `FillSizing()`
This sizing makes the component "fill" the parent component -- it will be the same size as the parent,
minus any paddings the parent has, and minus any margins the component has.

#### `FitSizing()`
This sizing makes the component shrink or grow to fit to its contents.

---

An example of using both `FillSizing` and `FitSizing` is a menu item.

You'd want the menu item to stretch horizontally to fit the menu, but you'd want the height to be the same as whatever's inside the menu item, such as text.
