# Downloading Kristal

<Box>
There are three methods of downloading and using Kristal.

- Using a beta release
- Using a nightly release
- Using the source code

Beta releases are created every time we deem the engine stable enough to be used by the public. As Kristal is still in development, **we do not recommend beta releases.**

Nightly releases are created every time a change is made to the code. This means that nightly releases are the most up-to-date version of Kristal, but they are also untested.

Using the source code is the most complicated method, but it also gives you the most control over Kristal. This method is recommended for developers who want to contribute to Kristal.

**If you want to play mods, use the latest nightly release.**

**If you want to make mods, use the source code.**

## Source code
---

There are multiple ways to use the source code, but both require installing [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/).

Once LÖVE is installed, you can either use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) or download the source code as a ZIP archive.

### Using Git (Recommended)
