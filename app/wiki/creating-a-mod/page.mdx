# Creating a Mod

<Box>

In the Kristal mod list, there's a button at the bottom which says "Create a new mod".

In here, you can configure things like the name of your mod,
the description, what chapter of DELTARUNE it's based on,
and you can configure each feature changed between chapters.

You can view the full list of configurable features [here](/wiki/configurable-features).

## Installing Visual Studio Code
---

Visual Studio Code is the recommended code editor for Kristal mods. You can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Once it's installed, open the extensions tab on the left-hand side of the screen, and search for "Kristal". Install the extension. This is our official extension for Kristal support in Visual Studio Code, and it will make your life much easier.

That's it, you're now ready!

## Opening your mod in Visual Studio Code
---

With your mod folder open, either right click inside of it, or right click the folder itself, and click "**Open with Code**".
In the screenshot below, I'm using Visual Studio Code Insiders, but it's the same no matter what version you use.

Make sure to click "**Yes, I trust the authors**" when prompted -- you're the author, because this is your mod!
