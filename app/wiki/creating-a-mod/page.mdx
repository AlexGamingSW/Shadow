# Creating a Mod

<Box>

In the Kristal mod list, there's a button at the bottom which says "Create a new mod".

![](/wiki/create_new_mod.png)

In here, you can configure things like the name of your mod,
the description, what chapter of DELTARUNE it's based on,
and you can configure each feature changed between chapters.

You can view the full list of configurable features [here](/wiki/configurable-features).
