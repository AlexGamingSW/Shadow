# Installing and Playing Mods

<Box>

When you open Kristal, the main menu has an option to open the mods folder. This is where you can place the mods you have downloaded.

Note that, if packaged correctly, you do not have to unzip the mod. You can just place the zip file in the mods folder.

## "The option doesn't work/crashes Kristal!" [manual-paths]

The cause of this bug is unknown, and most likely is out of our control. In this case, you'll have to navigate to the mods folder manually.

### Beta/Nightly release

The path is at `C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\Kristal\mods\`.

### Source code

**Windows:** `C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\LOVE\Kristal\mods\`
**Mac:** `/Users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/Library/Application Support/LOVE/Kristal/`
**Linux:** `$XDG_DATA_HOME/love/kristal/` OR `~/.local/share/love/kristal/`
